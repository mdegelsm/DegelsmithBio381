# Using a singular regular expression to change expressions 

```
1. 
	Find: \h+
	Replace: ,
```

This found all spaces and got rid of them

```
2. 
	Find: (\w+), (\w+), (\w*.*)
	Replace: \2 \1 \(\3\)
```

This selected the sections of the text, reversed the first and last name, and put parenthesis around the university
	
```
 3. 
  Find: \w(00)
  Replace: \r000
  ```
  	
This created a list from 0 to 4
	

```
 4. 
   Find: (\d{4})\s(\w*.*)(.mp3)
   Replace: \1\3

	
```

This took the 0001 - 0004 and put it before the .mp3

```
 5. 
  Find: (\w)\w+,(\w+),\d*.\d*,(\d*\s)
  Replace: \1_\2,\3
  ```
  
This selected the names and replaced them with the first letter of the genus, and underscore, the species, and two numeric variables


```
 6. 
  Find: (\w)\w+,(\w{4})\w+,\d*.\d*,(\d*\s)
  Replace: \1_\2,\3
  
  ```
	
This did the same thing as 5 but only with the first for letters of the species
	
```
7.
	Find: (\w{3})\w+,(\w{3})\w+,(\d*.\d*),(\d*)
	Replace:\1\2, \4, \3
```

This took the first three letters of the genus and the first three letters of the species and put them together, and then reversed the numbers
